## Login and registration flows

Authentication is controlled by NextAuth.

Users can register and sign-in using two methods:

- Credentials (email/password combination)

This creates 4 different authentication flows:

1. Register with a social account
2. Register with credentials
3. Sign-in with a social account:
4. Sign-in with credentials
